        The Equation of a Circle
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Equation of a Circle centered at the origin (0, 0)
        and the Equation of a Circle whose center is not at the origin are 
        very similar equations. <br><br> When there has been a shift and the center of 
        circle is no longer positioned at (0, 0), then the Standard Form of the 
        Equation of a circle must be used. <br> If the circle's center is at (0, 0) 
        the first equation should be used for ease of calculation. <br>

    <div id="explanation">
        <p>
            The formula for the Equation of a Circle is the same each time,
            just like the slope-intercept equation, y = mx + b. <br> For the circle's equation, 
            the goal is to substitute the values of each variable into the formula. <br><br>
            After substituting for the center's coordinates (h, k) on the left side of the equation, 
            you do not touch the left-side of the equation anymore; you have your answer
            just by substituting. <br><br> 
            It is important to understand that the coordinates of
            the center of the circle (h, k) is just an ordered pair of the form (x, y). The problem is 
            we can't use variables (x, y) to represent the location of the center of the circle, because 
            those variables have already been used in the formulas for the equation of a circle. 
            Therefore, different variables were chosen to represent the coordinates of the circle's center. <br><br> 
            Therefore, for a circle's center, the general format of an ordered pair (x, y) becomes (x, y) = (h, k); 
            where x = h, and y = k. <br><br>
            When substituting in the length of the circle's radius for variable r on the right-hand side of the equation, 
            you will need to calculate the numerical value of r<sup>2</sup>.  The right-hand side of the 
            equation's answer is represented as numerical value, not r<sup>2</sup>.  If you substitute the radius, 
            but don't simplify its value, your answer will be wrong.
            <br>
            (*Careful! Recall: r<sup>2</sup> = (radius)x(radius), NOT (2)x(radius))

            Let's look at a few examples of circles and their corresponding equations:
            <br>
            Example #1:
        </p>
        <img src="images/example1.png" alt="exam. 1" id="example1" />
        <p id="img_float">
            The circle shown in the image has a radius of 5 units <br> 
            and its center(h, k) is at (0, 0). 
            Therefore, r = 5, h = 0, and k = 0.
            <br><br>
            The Standard Form for the Equation of a Circle is: <br>
            <span style="align-content: center">
                (x - h)<sup>2</sup> + (y - k)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup>
            </span>
            <p id="solutionProblem1">
                Step 1: Substitute h, k, and r into the equation: <br>
                (x - 0)<sup>2</sup> + (y - 0)<sup>2</sup> = 5<sup>2</sup><br>
                Step 2: Simplify inside of the parentheses and also calculate the radius squared: <br>
                x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 25 
                <br><br>
                The Answer is: <br>
                x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 25

            The circle shown in the image has a radius of 10 units <br>

                Step 2: Simplify inside of the parentheses and also calculate the radius squared: <br>

                The Answer is: <br>

            Notice when substituting in the value of h = 0, (x - h) becomes (x - 0)<sup>2</sup>. <br>
            <br>
            As part of 'Step 2' and simplifying inside the parentheses, notice (x - 0) means any number (ie. variable 'x') minus zero. So (x - 0)<sup>2</sup>
            becomes (x)<sup>2</sup> which becomes x<sup>2</sup> because the parentheses are no longer necessary. Leaving the answer unsimplified will
            generate a wrong answer. 
            <br><br> 
            You should never answer (x - 0)<sup>2</sup> or (y - 0)<sup>2</sup>. 
            Always rewrite the terms as 
            x<sup>2</sup> or  y<sup>2</sup>.

            Notice that when an ordered pair is positive (h = 15) the subtract sign remains
            before and after the substitution since the number you are substituting is irrelevant 
            to the formula having a subtract sign.  Only if a coordinate is negative (k = -12) does
            the subtract sign matter. And as discussed above, substituting a negative number will
            always result in an addition sign inside the parentheses.
